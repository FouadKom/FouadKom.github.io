Interconnecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices creates a network of services capable of working together to accomplish certain goals in different domains. The heterogeneous nature of IoT environments makes it critical to find devices that extend existing architectures and helps in reaching the desired goal; especially if we have to take into consideration data privacy. In this paper, we present a Linked Open Data (LOD) based approach to semantically annotate and recommend IoT devices while adding a layer of data security and privacy through implementing the SOLID (SOcial LInked Data) framework.

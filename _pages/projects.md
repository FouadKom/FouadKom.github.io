## [Linked Data Similarity](https://github.com/FouadKom/lds):
- An open-source Java-Maven project
- LDS includes the implementation of almost all existing semantic similarity measures that are based on Linked Open Data (LOD).
- LDS was the base for my proposed IoT device Recommendation System and the engine for device comparison.

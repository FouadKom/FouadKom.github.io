## Projects
### [Linked Data Similarity](https://github.com/FouadKom/lds):
- Designed and Implemented an open-source Java-Maven project implementing some of the semantic similarity measures based on Linked Open Data (LOD).
- LDS was the base for my proposed IoT device Recommendation System and the engine for device comparison.

### AWS Based Content Management System (CMS):
- Configured an EC2 instance on AWS running Debian 11/Ubuntu/CentOS.
- Installed and configured a complete LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) on the EC2 instance.
- Deployed WordPress on the server.
- Configured DNS settings to point to the EC2 instance, enabling domain-specific access.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Tours, France.

My research work bridges the Semantic Web, specifically Linked Open Data, with the Internet of Things (IoT) to recommend devices. My work was carried out at the Laboratoire d‚ÄôInformatique Fondamentale et Appliqu√©e de Tours ([LIFAT](https://univ-tours.hal.science/LIFAT)) and within the context of the Center-Val-Loire [Smart Loire](https://smartloire.univ-tours.fr/) project.

During my Ph.D., I developed extensive experience in **Java programming**, applying it to various research and practical projects over several years. This hands-on experience allowed me to build robust and efficient software solutions that support my research in semantic web technologies and IoT. Additionally, I have spent two years working as an **SQL developer**, where I honed my skills in database management, query optimization, and data integration, crucial for managing and analyzing large datasets.

Beyond my research, I have a strong interest in **Cybersecurity**, **Data Analytics**, **Data Engineering**, and **Machine Learning**. I have obtained several certifications in these domains, continually expanding my knowledge and staying updated with the latest advancements. My diverse skill set and experience enable me to approach problems from multiple angles, providing innovative solutions in both academic and professional settings.

With a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, I am passionate about advancing technology and contributing to projects that make a tangible impact. My combined expertise in semantic technologies, programming, and data management positions me well for tackling complex challenges in today's data-driven world.

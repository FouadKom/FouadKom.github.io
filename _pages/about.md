I hold a Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Tours, France.

My research work combines between the Semantic Web, specifically Linked Open Data and the Internet of Things
(IoT) for recommendation of devices. It is based on the utilization of semantic annotations and concepts derived
from the Linked Open Data for device description as well as similarity measures for distinguishing similar devices.
My work is carried in Laboratoire d’Informatique Fondamentale et Appliquée de Tours (LIFAT), and in the
context of the Center-Val-Loire Smart Loire region project.

I'm interested in **Cybersecurity**, **Machine Learning** and **Data** with several certifications in these domains.
